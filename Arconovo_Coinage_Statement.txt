On July 31, 2025, at 4:46 PM IST, I, Dr. Anil P. Dongre, coined the term "Arconovo." This word represents a positive and harmonious fusion of ancient wisdom and modern innovation, intended for use in open-source projects, literature, or branding to symbolize the integration of timeless principles with contemporary progress. The term is freely available for use in open-source contexts, provided attribution is given to me, Dr. Anil P. Dongre, as its creator.
